#Hello!

> I am currently working on a web software product with a small team of entrepreneurs and developers. Previously, I worked with a talented team at [Smashing Ideas](http://smashingideas.com). In both roles, my focus has been primarily on front end web development for desktop and mobile devices.</p>

I grew up in Montana where I earned my graphic design degree from Montana State University in 2009. Shortly after graduating I moved to Seattle to pursue a career in user experience design and development. I'm passionate about what I do and feel most fulfilled when I'm solving problems that require both creative and technical thinking.

When I'm not sitting in front of a text editor, I keep myself busy playing guitar, riding my skateboard, or doodling in my sketchbook. I also enjoy attending tech meetups in the Seattle area. If you're interested in getting in touch with me, send me a message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/danielpquinn) or [email](mailto:dan@danquinndesign.com) me.
